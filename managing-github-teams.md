# Managing GitHub teams
The [Amsterdam UMC organization on GitHub](https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC) can be further structured in teams, sub-teams, sub-sub-teams, etc. (details on GitHub teams [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)). This structure roughly maps to departments (teams) and research groups within those departments (sub-teams). Below is a brief FAQ on how to organize teams within the Amsterdam UMC GitHub organizaiton. 

## I need access to the organization, team X, or sub-team Y
If you'd like to manage a GitHub team on behalf of an Amsterdam UMC department, please get in touch with Thomas Pronk. If you'd like to be added to a team, in order to create a sub-team or a new code repository, please get in touch with the GitHub representative of your department.

## How should I name my team or sub-team?
For a team, use the full English name of the department, followed by an abbreviation for that name in parentheses. For a sub-team, use the abbreviation of the deparment, followed by ` - `, followed by your sub-team name. 

For example, imagine you'd like to establish a team for the Research Data Management department and a sub-team for the Software Management group (which is part of the Research Data Management department). Please name your team and sub-team as follows:
* **Team name.** Research Data Management (RDM)
* **Sub-team name.** RDM - Software Management
