# Who can see my membership?
You can show or hide your membership of the Amsterdam UMC GitHub organization to the public in your [user settings;](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership). Your team memberships are not public, but only visible to fellow members of Amsterdam UMC.

# How do I get access?
If you'd like to manage a GitHub team on behalf of an Amsterdam UMC department, please get in touch with Thomas Pronk. If you'd like to be added to a team, in order to create a sub-team or a new code repository, please get in touch with the GitHub representative of your department.

# How should I name my team?
For a team, use the full English name of the department, followed by an abbreviation for that name in parentheses. For a sub-team, use the abbreviation of the deparment, followed by ` - `, followed by your sub-team name. 

For example, imagine you'd like to establish a team for the Research Data Management department and a sub-team for the Software Management group (which is part of the Research Data Management department). Please name your team and sub-team as follows:
* **Team name.** Research Data Management (RDM)
* **Sub-team name.** RDM - Software Management
