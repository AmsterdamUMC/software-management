# Amsterdam UMC Research Software Management 
Software Management comprises activities and products that make your software better; i.e., have less bugs, be easier to maintain, be more efficient. Because research software can be very dynamic, Amsterdam UMC takes a light-weight approach to software management ([Martinez-Ortiz et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7589725)) as a starting point. We are making set of guides for the most important software management aspects, which you can find below.
