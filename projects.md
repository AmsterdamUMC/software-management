# Publicizing projects
Github is not the best way to publicize your project because a project is more than just a software repository. Your project may even prescribe the use of another version control platform than GitHub. Therefore we use [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org) (RSD) to describe projects. Each project has its own landing page and links to its repository (or repositories), which may be on the Amsterdam UMC GitHub or other platforms.

## Organization of RDS
Amsterdam University Medical Centers is one of the organizations on RDS. Each department of the Amsterdam UMC can have its own research unit on RDS. To have your department added, contact Thomas Pronk. 
Each department can have multiple projects. To create a project, open your department's research unit page and click on '''Maintainers''' to see who can grant you access.

Once you have permission to make changes, you can login to RDS with your Amsterdam UMC account (choose SURFConext).

## What not to put on RDS
Any research project for which you want to disseminate software is suitable for publication on RDS. The project does not need to be an officially funded project. Out of scope are:
* Projects that are not really projects but merely a GitHub repository
* Projects for personal software artifacts (e.g., your home automation scripts)
* Projects for educational software products (e.g., programming exercises)

Note that the above may have repositories on the Amsterdam UMC GitHub, despite of being out of scope for RDS.
