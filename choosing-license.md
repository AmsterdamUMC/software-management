# Choosing a license
Make sure that your code is accompanied with an appropriate license. This will make it clear to your audience what they are allowed to do with your code and that you provide no warrenty for the correctness, safety, and security of your code.

## Are you allowed to license?
Code written as part of your employment contract with Amsterdam UMC is the intellectual property of Amsterdam UMC, even if it was written outside working hours or for a project with external funding. Therefore, before open sourcing your code make sure that it will not harm the commercial interest of Amsterdam UMC; valorisation is considered the fourth core task of UMCs! When in doubt, contact [IXA](https://www.ixa.nl), which is Amsterdam UMC's knowledge transfer office.
In any case, inform your supervisor of your intents before open sourcing.

## Software licenses
There are many kinds of software licenses, which makes the choice difficult. If your code is part of a project or programme that prescribes a particular license, then it is easy: use that particular license. Otherwise, [this tool can help you choose](https://choosealicense.com).

Once you have chosen a license, make your that your code is labelled with it. 
[GitHub makes it easy to attach a license to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository).

## Data licenses
Software licenses are not ideal for data.
